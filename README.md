# Midterm-Projects-Predictive-Modeling-with-Boston-Housing-Loan-Data
This repository includes midterm assignments from ADTA 5340 focused on predictive modeling using real-world datasets. Two distinct projects are covered:

üè† Boston Housing Project: Regression modeling on housing price data using features like room count, location, and pollution to predict median home values.

üí∞ Loan Default Prediction: Classification analysis to determine the likelihood of loan default using borrower information and loan history.

Each project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.), and evaluation metrics. Tools used include Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
